“Will a customer accept the coupon?” The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not.

Include a brief nontechnical report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons:

**Campaign Overview**
The campaign distributed 12,684 coupons with 7,210 customers using the coupons resulting in a 57% acceptance rate.

**Best Performing Groups**
Carry-out and takeaway coupons showed the strongest performance, with almost 3 out of 4 customers (74%) redeeming offers.

Younger customers under 21 responded best, with 63% utilizing the coupons. Customers earning between $50,000-$62,500 annually showed strong interest at 60% usage. Customers with some high school education had the highest response rate at 72%. The optimal timing was 2 PM, when 66% of customers redeemed their coupons. Sunny weather also increased participation to 59%.

**Location Impact**
Customers were 16% more likely to redeem coupons when businesses were located closer to them, demonstrating that convenience drives usage.

**Underperforming Segment**
Bar-related coupons had the lowest performance, with only 41% of customers redeeming them which is significantly below the overall campaign average.

**Recommendations for Future Analysis**
A deeper examination of seasonal purchasing patterns could provide valuable insights, particularly comparing customer behavior and coupon usage during warmer months versus colder seasons.
